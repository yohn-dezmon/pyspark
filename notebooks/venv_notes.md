# Notes

- I'm using the `general` venv on this machine
  - see `Tech/Python/virtualenv` for how to instantiate
- I ran the following:
  - `pip install jupyterlab`
  - `pip install pyspark`
  - `pip install pandas`
- now within a given notebook, `import pyspark` works (!!)

# Download path

> pip show pyspark
> Location: c:\users\johnd\general\lib\site-packages

I had to add this to PATH as well as SPARK_HOME
